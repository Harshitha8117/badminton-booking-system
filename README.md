# ▶ **One-Click Run (Windows)**

This project includes a **single-click `.bat` launcher**.

### Run everything:

```
double-click: run_project.bat
```

The script will:

* Install backend deps
* Start backend
* Install frontend deps
* Start frontend
* Open browser automatically

# 🚀 **Local Setup (Manual)**

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

Backend runs at:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

# 🧪 **Concurrency Test (Double-Booking Prevention)**

To verify atomic booking:

```
cd backend
node tests/concurrencyTestAuto.js
```

Expected output:

* **1 booking succeeds**
* Remaining requests → `409 Resource already booked at this time`

This proves the system prevents race-condition double-booking.
